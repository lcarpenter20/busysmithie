        Mission Statement: 
    <p>
    <p>
        To create a website for Smith College students to easily find places to study off campus in Northampton due to the recent 
        renovation of Neilson library. This website will work as a tool to find different cafes and coffee shops, including a criteria 
        of ambience, lighting, and overall quality as a study space.
        Our initial ideas for this website involved something to do with helping Smithies, but we weren’t quite sure. It eventually 
        developed into an idea where we could be both interactive in our research and informative in our website. We knew that we both 
        wanted to explore Northampton more, and we decided we could do that with the different cafes and coffee shops in the area, thus 
        our website consists of some of the main cafes students studied at.

        Major Design Points: 
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goals consisted of making our website attractive, user-friendly and most importantly, informative. We took it upon ourselves 
        to research as much as we could about the different cafes and coffee shops in Northampton and decided to display our research in 
        the most helpful way possible. When designing the layout of our site we kept this particular goal in mind. The two main sections 
        of the content, the information column and photogrid, were designed to deliver as much information as possible with just a glance 
        or a brief skim by the user. The images we obtained from cafes we researched in Northampton were landscape and portrait oriented. 
        As a result, we wanted to create a grid effect where each landscape and portrait oriented image were aligned nicely with each other. 
        We incorporated equal whitespace between the images and between the photogrid and the information column. In addition to whitespace 
        and layout, the colors and other stylistic features we used in our site enhanced the site’s effectiveness. We decided that a soft 
        blue would be simple, in addition with white and gray. Although there isn’t much user interaction besides the dropdown and some other 
        mouse interactions, we decided that this would be sufficient enough since we were looking for a simple, clean website.

     Required Elements:
    <p>       
    
    <p>
    Style sheets:
        Our website consisted of using one style sheet, in which everything in it dealt with the aesthetic aspects of all 
        the pages in our website. The style sheets dealt with things such as our navigation bar, positions, colors, font-sizes, and much more; 
        these included the standard rules that were discussed in class. In our style sheets, we implemented the standard, class, psuedoclass, 
        and ID/named selectors. An example of pseudoclass was when we used it for our drop down menu so when you hovered over it, a certain 
        color would have changed when the mouse is over them.
    <p>

    <p>
        Navigation aids:     
        The main navigation aid in this website was our navigation bar, which is viewed in the same position of all the pages, at the 
        very top of the screen. We took some inspiration from Woodstar Cafe’s layout (https://www.woodstarcafe.com/)  in the sense that 
        they had a logo on the top left corner, a navigation bar at the top, and another way to navigate the page at the bottom of the page. 
        We believe that the navigation bar is both stylistic, interactive, and functional for anyone who visits the page. The links change 
        colors when the mouse is hovered over it, in addition to a drop down bar for the different cafes we rated. It is also simple and 
        effective, with not much flamboyance to it. We knew stylistically, we wanted to keep this website clean, simple, and effective, 
        which is seen throughout the website. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Structured layout:
        Our layout consists of three main areas: the navigation bar, the body and the footer. This layout is found in all of our pages to 
        demonstrate consistency and add to our overall simplistic aesthetic. The content of the body for all of the cafe pages and map page 
        is divided into two columns. We wanted to focus on the images so we decided to make the image grid for the cafes and the picture 
        for the map page to take up about 75% of the body’s width. This left about 25%  of the body’s width for information about the cafes 
        and the map. We were able to accomplish this by creating columns with divisions and making them responsive (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_grid_responsive.asp). The homepage is the only 
        page where the content of the body was different. Instead of separating the body into two columns we decided to expand the image page 
        to the full width of the body. We believe this creates a welcoming and intriguing first page which provides an overall idea of what our 
        website features. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        The layout of our page enhances our mission in the sense that it helps with our simple, clean layout. That being said, we decided to 
        have all of the links for the cafes under one tab in the navigation bar; that way, it wouldn’t look too cluttered. 
        For each cafe page, we have the information on the left with the pictures on the right, following a grid-like layout. The pictures 
        were designed to be in three columns with a proportional space between the pictures. This is more structured than a default single 
        scrolling content because it is less “boring” in a sense. We wanted the audience to be thoroughly engaged with our website and we 
        believed that scrolling too much would detract from its appeal. We also used multiple columns and fixed elements to help with our 
        consistent look.

        JavaScript:
    </p>
    
    <p>
    
        Javascript is used throughout our site, for the navigation bar (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp)- specifically, 
        the cafe tab, and for the collapsibles (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp) found in the cafe pages and the 
        map page. We adapted the source we used for the navigation bar to make only one of our tabs in the navigation 
        bar to have a dropdown. The source we used for the collapsibles were adapted to include a similar layout we used for the ratings 
        where the content of the “Hours” collapsible is made using a table with two columns so the day and hours were side by side. We had 
        to adapt the javascript to show this stylistic display of the content. We also used collapsibles in our map page where the user can 
        find the locations of each of the cafe by clicking on the name. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
    Images:
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe that one of the important elements of our website were the images -- not only do they serve a visual purpose and intrigue 
        the audience, but also provide information to the cafes that we researched about. We thought taking pictures ourselves would provide 
        ample information in addition to our descriptions and ratings of each cafe. Also, a picture is said to be worth a thousand words, so 
        the pictures let the audience have a grasp of how the cafe is, what the vibe is (to a certain extent), and see what kind of cafe it is. 
        We chose to display the different pictures on the homepage because the audience will scan the page to intrigue them. Additionally, we 
        put a number of pictures on each cafe’s link for more information.
